BSOV Mining Pool


## What is BitcoinSoV

BitcoinSoV is an ERC918 token that burns 1% of each transation, allowing it to be deflationary over time and acting as a Store of Value. BitcoinSov is based on the 0xBitcoin ERC918 Mineable Token, which allows users to mine against an Ethereum smart contract that automatically adjusts difficulty to meet a 10-13 minute block time.


## What is HashTables

HashTables is a small crypto community that works to support games, dapps, and developers that meet our quality, security, and community requirements.


## How do I mine BitcoinSoV

Windows: 


Linux:


Mac OSX:


## How does the pool work?

The pool is based on 0xBitcoin's tokenpool and allows the combined hash power of multiple miners to work on a single solution.  Shares of a solution are given to miners based on the submitted work, and they are paid a share of the reward tokens from each mined block.


## How frequent are payouts?

Payouts are mde every 4 hours and logged to the [bsov-pool repository](https://github.com/HashTablesNet/bsov-pool.hashtables.net/tree/payment_logs/payment_logs).

Payouts are done using our [multisend & minting contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0xC9EE35000F51e5C343c506fc0E8C8c95cF862C6d) in batches. If a transaction has made it to this repository with a transaction hash, it has been credited in our system as a payment.
